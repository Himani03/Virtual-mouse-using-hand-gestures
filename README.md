# Virtual-mouse-using-hand-gestures
Instead of a physical mouse, a real-time camera that recognises hand landmarks and analyses gesture patterns was used to create an AI-based method for controlling mouse movement. 
With help of this code, we can use our hands to operate the mouse and do actions such as clicking, double click, drag etc.
